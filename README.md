<p>The "Recruiter System" project is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the recruitment process for organizations. Upon execution, the system presents a splash screen featuring the project title, providing users with a visually engaging introduction. Users are prompted to proceed by clicking the "Continue" button, initiating the login process.
The login page serves as the gateway to the system, where users are required to authenticate themselves using a username and password. Upon successful authentication, users gain access to the home page, the central hub of the system's functionality.
The home page boasts a user-friendly interface and offers four primary functionalities through distinct options: "Add Candidate," "View Candidates," "Update Candidate," and "Remove Candidate."
The "Add Candidate" feature facilitates the addition of new candidates to the system's database. Users are presented with JTextField fields to input essential candidate details, including ID, name, gender, father's name, date of birth, phone, email, highest education, 10th%, 12th%, and graduation%. Upon input completion, users can proceed by clicking the "Add Details" button, with an option to return to the previous page via the "Back" JButton.
The "View Candidates" functionality provides users with a comprehensive view of all candidates stored in the database. Leveraging database integration, users can search, print, update, and navigate back to the previous page. Furthermore, users can employ filtering options to display the top 5, top 10, low, and high performers based on academic scores, including 10th%, 12th%, and graduation%.
The "Update Candidate" feature empowers users to modify existing candidate information. Users can edit candidate details such as name, gender, father's name, date of birth, phone, email, graduation%, 10th%, and 12th% with ease. Upon completion of updates, users can finalize the process by clicking the "Update" button or revert to the previous page using the "Back" JButton.
Lastly, the "Remove Candidate" functionality enables users to delete candidates from the system by specifying the candidate ID. Leveraging this feature, users can efficiently manage candidate records, ensuring data accuracy and relevance.
Through its intuitive interface and robust functionality, the "Recruiter System" project aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the recruitment process, empowering organizations to make informed hiring decisions while optimizing candidate management practices.Scope of the Work</p>
